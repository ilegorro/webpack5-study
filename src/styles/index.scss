@use 'global';
@use 'hero';

/*
The @use is similar to @import. but has some notable differences:
    - The file is only imported once, no matter how many times you @use it in a project.
    - Variables, mixins, and functions (what Sass calls “members”) that start with an underscore (_) or hyphen (-) are considered private, and not imported.
    - Members from the used file are only made available locally, but not passed along to future imports.
    - Similarly, @extends will only apply up the chain; extending selectors in imported files, but not extending files that import this one.
    - All imported members are namespaced by default.
